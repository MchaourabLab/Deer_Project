# Goal
Develop a transformer model



# Background  
DEER (double electron-electron resonance) spectroscopy measures the distance between two labels (or “spins”) selectively placed on a protein molecule. A set of such distance measurements can be used to develop a structural model of the protein or to determine how it moves under varying conditions to perform its biological function. Both the label and the protein itself are not rigid resulting in a distribution of distances as opposed to a single fixed distance between the spins. The distribution of distances contains important biological information and it is its sensitivity to the details of the distribution that make DEER valuable.


# Purpose
It is easy for us to get the value of V(t) when we know P(r), but mathematically speaking, it is difficult to calculate P(r) from V(t). Therefore, we want to try to use mochine learning to simulate p(r) based on V(t)


# Data
Data of this project is generated from some functions instead of being collected in experiment, which means we can have whatever kinds of data we want. 

1. Generate distribution
2. Noise level
